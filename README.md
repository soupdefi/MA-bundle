# MA-bundle

Simple package of all the MAs/EMAs I use in conjunction.

- Purple: 24 EMA
- Pink: 36 EMA
- Yellow: 100 SMA
- Cyan: 100 EMA
- Dark blue: 200 EMA

I use this combination of EMAs because they can all, with the _(arguable)_ exception of the 200 EMA, be flexibly applied to any timeframe to gauge any length of trend (LTF, MTF, HTF). Do note that these are not all-encompassing trading indicators, and are rather intended on being used as demonstrations of trend and applied alongside tangential confluences.
